    <h2>Namast√©!</h2>
    <p>I am <strong>Dirk Rombauts</strong>, and I love <strong>spirituality</strong> and <strong>energy work</strong>. I am a Reiki Master, shamanic practicioner, firewalk trainer, and ice bath trainer.
      My main career, however, is in IT - and I love making homepages. I know that for many energy workers, a <strong>home page</strong> (and computer stuff in general) is a burden - yet in today's world, these things are a <strong>necessity</strong>.</p>
      <p>If you want your homepage made by someone who really "gets" your work, then I'm your man!</p>

      <p>I will ...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sit down with you over a cup of your favorite hot beverage</li>
        <li>Chat with you about your passion</li>
        <li>Paint a picture of your world in my mind</li>
        <li>Create a website just for you</li>
        <li>Take care of all the technical details</li>
        <li>Be there for all changes over time</li>
        <li>Make sure your website conforms to the GPDR and suchlike</li>
      </ul>
